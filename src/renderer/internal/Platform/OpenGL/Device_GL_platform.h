/*
 * glad/gles2.h provides the OpenGLES 3.2 API including the extensions that RAMSES uses.
 * The file is generated - see inline documentation for configuration parameters.
 * gladLoadGLES2() needs to be called after context creation to initialize the function pointers
 *
 * This is also expected to work if the context is a GL context >= 3.2 (instead of a GLES context)
 * However, this won't make the context GLES3 compatible by itself. It still requires an extension
 * to support GLES3 shaders (e.g. GL_ARB_ES3_2_compatibility)
